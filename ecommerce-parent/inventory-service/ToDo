Validation – add @NotBlank, @Positive etc. in DTOs so you don’t save invalid products.

Error handling – e.g. @ControllerAdvice for clean error JSON.

Pagination – when listing products, use Pageable instead of returning all at once.

Auth (optional) – for now it’s open, but later you may want only ADMIN/SHOP service to create or delete products.
